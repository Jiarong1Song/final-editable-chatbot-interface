# Editable AI Chatbot
◕ ◞ ◕ This project was made using https://netnet.studio

This is a project where I reimagined the experience with AI Chatbots. When the user first sends out the question, the bar for the input will be hidden. The user can only choose to edit their original question or ask another question. This interactive approach allows users to modify the ongoing conversation based on their actions and refine their instructions to the AI system because giving clear instructions and prompts would be a important aspect when we use this kind of technology these days.(Still in development with adding GPT3-API in).
